            <p>"So sorry we had to go home after only one night. We will definitely stay two nights next time!"</p>
            <p>"This apartment is close to everything. We didn't need the car as the walks were amazing"</p>
            <p>"Your attention to detail made our stay so relaxed and comfortable. It was such a shame we had to
                drive back to our little flat, which is smaller than your apartment. We want to move in!"</p>
            <p>"Cosy and comfortable. We imagined we owned it and enjoyed being spoilt. Thank you." </p>
            <p>"What a magical stay at such an amazing place. Completely self-contained and very private. We loved
                it and will return again and again."</p>
            <p>"Never felt so spoilt. A perfect get away and so close to everything. We had the best bath ever!"</p>
            <p>"A few minutesâ€™ walk from the beach, picnic basket in hand and towel over the shoulder - can't think
                of anything better except that wonderful breakfast. That bacon is the best in Melbourne!"</p>
            <p>Relaxing in that sunny garden watching our dog chasing balls. Let me stay forever!"</p>
